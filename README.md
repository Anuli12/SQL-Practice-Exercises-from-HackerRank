# SQL-Practice-Exercises-from-HackerRank
This repository is a collection of SQL practice exercises from HackerRank that cover a range of topics and difficulty levels. It's an ideal resource for individuals who wish to enhance their SQL skills by working with real-world data.

As a data analyst myself, I found this exercise to be an excellent way to practice my SQL queries and gain experience in data analysis. The exercise provides various datasets, including population census, weather observations, employee salaries, African cities, and more. By using this data, I was given questions to answer by writing SQL queries. The questions ranged from simple calculations to more complex analysis tasks.

The exercise encompasses a range of SQL concepts such as basic syntax, data filtering and sorting, grouping and aggregation, as well as advanced techniques such as JOINs and subqueries. This enables anyone to practice SQL in a real-world context, which can aid in developing the skills needed to work with data.
